# Welcome!
I wrote this to give me a way to show myself and others what I can do with various technologies:
- Angular 9
- REST
- [Flask](https://github.com/mtoback/flask_webserver)  (and so, python 3.7)
- Docker
- Go (to be later added as a second server), and 
- PostgreSQL

The site generated for this is [here](http://www.iamasoftwareengineer.tech)

This is an iterative process, and a lot of it is understanding how to identify the problem. For instance, I ran into [this](https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core/issues/429) among a lot of other things.

And this, to me, is one of the biggest challege with software. Getting that "Hello World" application to play from the database to the UI, with automated deployment, testing, etc.

What you are looking at here is something that I started to conceive of on April 13, with the first iteration pushed to be pushed to Digital Ocean if all goes well later today (April 15).

# AngularFramework

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
